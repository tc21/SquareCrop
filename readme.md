Square Crop
==================

This app simply allows you to open an image, select a square region, and then save it to file.
It is written with wxPython_Phoenix in Python 3.

The Program's entry point is SquareCrop.py. The only dependency is wxPython_Phoenix.
You can run the script by running SquareCrop.py; put the scripts in a folder, make a setup file and install it with 
pip; or pass it into PyInstaller or something to create an executable app.
